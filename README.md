# OpenAlex Analysis

Scientific literature analysis using the OpenAlex API.

This repo provides classes and methods to extract statistics, plots and graphs, as well as examples in Jupyter Notebooks. There is also a web app built with Dash and some docker config files to deploy it.

For the documentation, open `doc/html/index.html` (you need to download the repo to open it in the browser for now).
