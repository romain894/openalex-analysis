 Sustainability research references, network, methods and theory landscape analysis within the Stockholm Resilience Centre.

This repo provides classes and methods to extract statistics, plots and graphs, as well as examples in Jupyter Notebooks from the Open\+Alex API. There is also a web app built with Dash and some docker config files to deploy it.

For the documentation, open {\ttfamily doc/html/index.\+html} (you need to download the repo to open it in the browser for now).
